## How to Use

1. Click on one of the images displayed in grid to see the quote of the day in a dialog.
2. To go to the details screen, press on the details button (i.e. the arrow) that is on the dialog 
3. Inside the details screen, you can find:
   -  the date information,
   -  the quote,
   -  the image,
   -  a textfield that you can use to add a comment,
   -  Next to the text field, there is a submit button (i.e. a tick). You can press on the button to submit
    
5. If you have already made a comment, then you will see a card that displays your comment instead of the textfield. Next to the card, there is an edit button that will switch to a textfield so that you can edit your comment for the day.
6. This project utilizes room database, so your comments will stay on the app even if you kill the app.
7. There are only 10 days (the first 10 days of the year&month you are using the app). This is sufficient to show the lazygrid's scroll functionality.
